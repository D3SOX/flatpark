# Update resolver for Antigravity IDE.

# Upstream publishes the update endpoint the IDE itself checks; its `latest`
# form answers unauthenticated with the current stable build:
# https://antigravity-ide-auto-updater-974169037036.us-central1.run.app/api/update/linux-x64/stable/latest
# That JSON carries the download URL (edgedl.me.gvt1.com) and the opaque build
# id, whose leading segment is the version. The feed also publishes its own
# sha256hash; we do not forward it, because the resolver contract has no field
# for a hash and update-pins.mjs recomputes sha256/size from the same URL.
