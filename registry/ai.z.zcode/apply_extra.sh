# /opt/ZCode (Chromium, app.asar, the bundled agent CLI and its ripgrep/ugrep/
# bfs helpers) plus icons and a .desktop file. Unpack the .deb data member and
# keep the app directory at /app/extra/ZCode, the stable path the wrapper execs.
# The desktop file, icon and AppStream metainfo are shipped by the manifest at
# *build* time — extra-data is fetched later on the user's machine, so anything
# Flatpak must export cannot come from here.
