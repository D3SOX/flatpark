# Prints the current version + the Linux x86_64 .deb as JSON on stdout:
#   { "version": "3.6.5", "releaseDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",

# Logs go to stderr. No hashing, no manifest rewriting — FlatPark downloads the
# URLs and computes the extra-data sha256/size at build time. The version is
# compared against the latest <release> in the AppStream metainfo.
#
# Z.ai publishes no release index: the download page carries the current
# version's URLs, and each release directory carries the electron-builder
# latest.yml. Read the URLs off the page, then confirm the version against that
# release's latest.yml so a page-layout change cannot pin a bogus version.
