# corrupt download cannot get here, but a full disk mid-unpack can. /bin/sh is
# bash in org.freedesktop.Platform; the subshell probe keeps this a no-op rather
# than a hard failure on a shell without pipefail.

# Runs offline at install time inside org.freedesktop.Platform. Upstream ships
# Cursor as a plain FHS .deb: the whole Electron application tree lives under
# /usr/share/cursor (Chromium, the VS Code-derived app resources, the bundled
# extensions and the `cursor` CLI), plus a desktop entry, an icon and a couple of
# system files. Keep the application directory at /app/extra/cursor, the stable
# path the wrapper execs.
#
# Not staged: etc/apparmor.d and etc/sysctl.d, which configure the host's
# unprivileged-userns policy for Chromium's own sandbox — inside Flatpak that
# job belongs to zypak. The desktop files, icon, MIME definition and AppStream
# metainfo are shipped by the manifest at *build* time, because extra-data is
# fetched later on the user's machine and anything Flatpak must export cannot
# come from here.
