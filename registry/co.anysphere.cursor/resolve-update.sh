# Logs go to stderr. No hashing, no manifest rewriting — FlatPark downloads the
# URL and computes the extra-data sha256/size at build time. The version is
# compared against the latest <release> in the AppStream metainfo.

# Upstream publishes no release index; the download page is driven by the same
# JSON endpoint the site itself calls. Its `stable` track carries every Linux
# artifact for the current build, of which we take the .deb — the AppImage needs
# libfuse, which no Flatpak runtime ships.
