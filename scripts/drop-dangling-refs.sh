# Drop refs whose commit object is not in the repo, and record the ref files so
# the caller can delete the same paths from R2 (see sync-r2.sh RECLAIM_REFS).
#
# Why this exists: sync-r2.sh uploads refs with `rclone copy`, which never
# deletes, so a ref that delist-prune removed locally survives in R2. Once
# prune reclaims that commit's objects, the leftover ref file is a dangling
# pointer — and publish's R2 reconcile syncs it straight back into the local
# repo, where the next summary regeneration (flatpak build-export does one on
# export) hard-fails with "No such metadata object <commit>.commit". That wedges
# every publish, not just the one after the de-list.
#
# Deleting here stays within the "targeted delete, never a blind mirror" rule:
# only refs whose commit object is provably absent are touched, and the local
# object store is an exact copy of R2's at this point in the run.
