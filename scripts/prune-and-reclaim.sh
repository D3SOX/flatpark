# Reclaim repo space with prune-diff targeted deletes (never a blind mirror):
#   1. delete refs for apps no longer in the registry (delist) — the app/<id>
#      ref and the runtime/<id>.{Debug,Locale,Sources} extensions exported with
#      it, and record them so their ref files can be deleted from R2 too,
#   1b. delete runtime/<id>.{Debug,Locale,Sources} refs whose app is still
#      listed but no longer declares that extension in its commit metadata —
#      otherwise step 2 pins the last build that did produce it, forever,
#   2. prune to the current commit of every remaining ref (keep current only —
#      fix forward, no rollback retention),
#   3. write the exact set of objects pruning removed to a reclaim list.
#
# The caller then re-signs the summary (publish-repo.sh) and runs sync-r2.sh
# with RECLAIM_LIST + RECLAIM_REFS pointed at the files written here, so the new
# summary goes live BEFORE the stale refs and orphaned objects are deleted from
# R2. Deleting the ref files matters: the refs upload is additive (rclone copy),
# so a ref only removed locally comes back with the next publish's R2 reconcile
# — dangling, since its objects are gone by then. See drop-dangling-refs.sh,
# which owns (and truncates) RECLAIM_REFS; this script appends to it.
